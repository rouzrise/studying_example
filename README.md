# Pixel Art Maker 

Pixel Art Maker is an online game which allows you to create pixel pictures of maximum size 12 squares height and 20 squares width.

### How to start

The game is available online by address [https://codepen.io/Rouzrise/full/WdOQzw/](https://codepen.io/Rouzrise/full/WdOQzw/)

### How to play

##### 1.Create canvas.

You should choose the height and the width of the Canvas and then press button **Create Canvas**. Without creating canvas you won't be able to start creating picture.

##### 2.Pick a color.

Pick a color for your square pixels. You can change color whenever you want. Your color by default is black.

##### 3.Create a picture.
After choosing color press any pixel on canvas - it will become colored. 
To clear pixel - press colored pixel one more time with the same color - it will become white. Otherwise you can choose white color from the colorpiquer.

**_TIP!!!_** If you want to color pixels faster - you can press the left mouse button and drag - all the pixels your mouse touches will become colored ( the same works for emptying).

##### 4. Emptying colors and deleting canvas.
You can **_Empty colors_** or **_Delete canvas_** by pressing buttons below the canvas.

**_WARNING!!!_** You cannot create pixel art when Canvas is empty after deleting it. You can create new canvas or use **ADD ROWS** button.

##### 5. Adding or deleting Rows.
You can add or delete outside rows by pressing buttons at the edges of canvas.
Please note that you cannot add rows if the canvas is full. You also cannot delete last row. At the same time you can add rows even if you already started making Pixel Art. Your creation will stay safe.

##### 6. Additional functionality.

If you hover cat and sheep pictures - look what happens next! :)
