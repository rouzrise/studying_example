<h5 id="create-canvas.">1.Create canvas.</h5>
<p>You should choose the height and the width of the Canvas and then press button **Create Canvas**. Without creating canvas you wonâ€™t be able to start creating picture.</p>
<h5 id="pick-a-color.">2.Pick a color.</h5>
<p>Pick a color for your square pixels. You can change color whenever you want. Your color by default is black.</p>
<h5 id="create-a-picture.">3.Create a picture.</h5>
<p>After choosing color press any pixel on canvas - it will become colored.</p>
<p>To clear pixel - press colored pixel one more time with the same color - it will become white. Otherwise you can choose white color from the colorpiquer.</p>
<p><strong><em>TIP!!!</em></strong> If you want to color pixels faster - you can press the left mouse button and drag - all the pixels your mouse touches will become colored ( the same works for emptying).</p>
<h5 id="emptying-colors-and-deleting-canvas.">4. Emptying colors and deleting canvas.</h5>
<p>You can <strong><em>Empty colors</em></strong> or <strong><em>Delete canvas</em></strong> by pressing buttons below the canvas.</p>
<p><strong><em>WARNING!!!</em></strong> You cannot create pixel art when Canvas is empty after deleting it. You can create new canvas or use <strong>ADD ROWS</strong> button.</p>
<h5 id="adding-or-deleting-rows.">5. Adding or deleting Rows.</h5>
<p>You can add or delete outside rows by pressing buttons at the edges of canvas.</p>
<p>Please note that you cannot add rows if the canvas is full. You also cannot delete last row. At the same time you can add rows even if you already started making Pixel Art. Your creation will stay safe.</p>
